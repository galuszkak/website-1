Being a great engineer takes much more than writing code. Soft Skills Engineering is a weekly podcast for
software developers who want to level up their engineering skills outside the realm of writing code. Our
hosts, <a href="https://twitter.com/jergason">Jamison Dance</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/djsmith42">Dave Smith</a>,
are here to make you laugh and make you wise as they answer your questions, dear listeners, on the air each week.
